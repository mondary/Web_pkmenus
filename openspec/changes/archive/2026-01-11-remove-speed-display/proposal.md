# Change: Remove Speed Display

## Why
The slideshow speed information is technical and not necessary for the daily use of the dashboard. The user wants to remove it to further simplify the UI.

## What Changes
- Remove the `.speed` element from the stage header in `index.html`.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `menu-display`
- Affected code: `index.html`
