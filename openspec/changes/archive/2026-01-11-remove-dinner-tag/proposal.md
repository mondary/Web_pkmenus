# Change: Remove Dinner Tag

## Why
The "Diner" tag is redundant or cluttered, and the user has requested its removal to clean up the UI.

## What Changes
- Remove the `<div class="tile-tag">Diner</div>` element from the menu rendering logic.
- (Optional) Clean up CSS related to `.tile-tag` if no longer used.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `menu-display`
- Affected code: `index.html`
