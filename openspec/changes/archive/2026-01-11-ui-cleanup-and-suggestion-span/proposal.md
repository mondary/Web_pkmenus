# Change: UI Cleanup and Suggestion Spanning

## Why
The user wants to simplify the sidebar by removing unnecessary text/labels and optimize the menu grid layout by making the suggestions tile more prominent.

## What Changes
- Hide the photo captions (legends like "Photo 1").
- Remove the "Diaporama actif" status text.
- Update the grid layout so the "Idee pour la suite" tile spans two columns, filling the empty space after Sunday.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `menu-display`
- Affected code: `index.html`
