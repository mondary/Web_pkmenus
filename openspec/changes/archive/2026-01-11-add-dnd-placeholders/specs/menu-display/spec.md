## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Drag and Drop Swapping
The system SHALL allow users to swap meals between days using drag and drop, providing clear visual feedback and indicating potential drop targets.

#### Scenario: Placeholders visibility
- **WHEN** the user starts dragging a tile
- **THEN** all other eligible tiles in the grid display a "placeholder" style (e.g., dashed border) to indicate they are valid drop zones.
