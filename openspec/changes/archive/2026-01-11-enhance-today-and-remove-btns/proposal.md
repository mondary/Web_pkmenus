# Change: Enhance Today Focus and Remove Control Buttons

## Why
The user wants a cleaner interface without control buttons (Fullscreen/Reload) and wants the current day to be even more prominent ("focus").

## What Changes
- Remove the "Plein ecran" and "Recharger" buttons from the sidebar.
- Enhance the `.is-today` CSS style to increase its visual impact (e.g., stronger glow, slightly different background).

## Impact
- Affected specs: `menu-display`
- Affected code: `index.html`
